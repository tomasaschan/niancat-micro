Feature: Niancat as a service
  "Dagens Nia" (literally "Todays Nine") is a puzzle in the Swedish newspaper Svenska Dagbladet.
  Nine letters are provided, in a scrambled order, and the goal is to figure out which nine letter word it is.
  There may be one or more solutions.
  Niancat is a bot which aids us in checking if a word is a solution to the puzzle, or not. It does this by checking
  that the word matches the letters in the puzzle and that it's present in a dictionary.

  A REPLY is a response sent to the Slack channel where the command was received.
  A NOTIFICATION is a response sent to a pre-defined public channel where people see results.
